# 100 Days of Code Day 10

Date : 3/14/2023
Time : 7:40am - 8:40am

## Goal(s)

Basic Nueral Network, using np for matrix math for now.  


- [X]  Refactor init to accept arbitrary shape.
- [X]  Refactor forward prop to work with arbitrary shape.
- [ ]  Refactor backward prop to work with arbitrary shape.
- [ ]  Refactor Update Params to work with arbitrary shape.

Notes: Spent longer than I would like to admit understanding the logic to build / forward prop the layers. Once this method is complete I think there is a better way to do it. So I have another refactor in my future.
