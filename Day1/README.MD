# 100 Days of Code Day 1

Date : 3/5/2023
Time : 7:45am - 9:00am

## Goal(s)

Wow Armory API basics
- [X] Get character
- [X] Get Score
- [X] Store credentials locally and ensure they don't get sent to Github.
- [X] Learn proper way to share VENV

Notes:
I don't know git as well as I thought I did, and even less so in vscode. However I have a pretty good handle on it now, at leasts the basics.

Wow api seems straightforward. Auth and basic pull structure seems straight forward. Nothing exciting was created today but looking forward to revisiting. I think I want to switch gears to looking at flask for tomorrow.
