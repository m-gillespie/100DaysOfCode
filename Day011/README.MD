# 100 Days of Code Day 11

Date : 3/14/2023
Time : 5:10am - 6:10am

## Goal(s)

Basic Nueral Network - Continueing Day 10


- [X]  Refactor init to accept arbitrary shape.
- [X]  Refactor forward prop to work with arbitrary shape.
- [X]  Refactor backward prop to work with arbitrary shape.
- [X]  Refactor Update Params to work with arbitrary shape.

Notes: Spent longer than I would like to admit understanding the logic to build / forward prop the layers. Backword prop and update params udpated. With shape of 784,25,25,10 reached 94% accuracy. Next want to refactor another way, and finally impliment saving of models.
