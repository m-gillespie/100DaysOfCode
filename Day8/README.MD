# 100 Days of Code Day 8

Date : 3/12/2023
Time : 5:15pm - 6:15pm

## Goal(s)

Basic Nueral Network, using np for matrix math for now.  

- [X]  Find MNIST data set -downloaded from kagle  https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
- [X]  Split data set into test and train
- [X]  Forward prop (Guess)
- [X]  Backward prop (Train)
- [X]  Test Accuracy ~90%!




Notes: undestand most of the math, would like to replace NP with custom matrix operations. May revisit. Tomorrow I want to work on generalizing some of the functions and add support for multiple layers. I had meant to upload this at 6:15 but after a quick break I couldn't stop working on it.
