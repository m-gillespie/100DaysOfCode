Date : 3/10/2023
Time : 7:10pm - 8:10pm

## Goal(s)

Flask day

- [X] Load char from API
- [X] In Memory cache API calls
- [X] In Memory "recenty viewed" navigation links

Notes:
Import templates, requests_cache was a decent solution for cache. Not sure how well it would scale but meets current requirement. 

flask --app Flask_Example run --debug
