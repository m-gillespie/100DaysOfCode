# 100 Days of Code Day 9

Date : 3/13/2023
Time : 5:00am - 6:00am

## Goal(s)

Basic Nueral Network, using np for matrix math for now.  

- [X]  Refactor Layers into dict
- [X]  Generalize initilaizer.
- [ ]  accept params for input size , number and shape of hiddens , size of output // Currently can set shape, but only one hidden.




Notes: Took longer than expected to refactor. Once done the math is already setup to be dynamic. Number of hidden layer(s) will take a bit longer to do. But that is for tomorrow.
